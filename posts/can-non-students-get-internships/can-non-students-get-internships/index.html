This article aims to explore the challenges and opportunities faced by non-traditional students in securing internships, providing actionable advice, and highlighting the unique contributions these individuals can make to organizations. Can Non-Students Get Internships? In today’s competitive job market, internships have become a crucial stepping stone for students seeking to gain valuable work experience and enhance their employability.
