Lack of Credit History:</strong></p><p>International students often don&rsquo;t have a U.S. credit history, which affects obtaining a car loan, making lenders uncertain about their creditworthiness.</p><p><strong>2. Stringent Lending Requirements:</strong></p><p>Lenders might impose stricter requirements for international students, such as higher credit scores, larger down payments, and shorter loan terms.</p><p><strong>3. Limited Loan Options:</strong></p><p>International students might have a limited range of loan options, with higher interest rates and fees compared to domestic borrowers.</p><p><strong>4. Potential for Predatory Lending:</strong></p><p>International students could fall victim to predatory lenders offering unfavorable terms, leading to financial difficulties.</p><p><strong>Strategies to Mitigate Risks:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Build a Credit History:</strong> Start establishing credit early by obtaining a secured credit card or becoming an authorized user.
