Let&rsquo;s break down the types of accommodation that NSFAS might consider:</p><h3 id=on-campus-housing><strong>On-Campus Housing:</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#on-campus-housing>#</a></h3><p>On-campus housing is the most common accommodation option for students.

First of all, your accommodation should be registered with the relevant authorities, and it should meet the necessary safety and quality requirements. Additionally, NSFAS might consider factors like your financial situation, personal circumstances, and the availability of alternative accommodation options.</p><h3 id=home-based-accommodation><strong>Home-Based Accommodation:</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#home-based-accommodation>#</a></h3><p>NSFAS may also provide funding for home-based accommodation if you&rsquo;re living with a guardian or family member. However, this is usually considered a short-term solution, and you may need to explore other options in the long run.</p><h3 id=how-to-apply-for-nsfas-funding><strong>How to Apply for NSFAS Funding:</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-apply-for-nsfas-funding>#</a></h3><p>Applying for NSFAS funding involves a few steps:</p><ol><li>Gather the necessary documents, including your ID, proof of income, and academic records.</li><li>Submit your application online through the myNSFAS portal.</li><li>Wait for your application to be processed.
