However, there are a few additional documents that you may be asked for:\nProof of Pension: This could be a pension statement or a letter from your pension provider confirming your income.

Pension income can be used to demonstrate affordability and reliability. Comparing quotes, considering a guarantor, and saving for a deposit can improve your chances of approval.
