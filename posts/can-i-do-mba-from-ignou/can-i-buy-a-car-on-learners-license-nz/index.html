This person must be over 25 years old and have held a full driver&rsquo;s license for at least two years. They must also be sitting in the front passenger seat and be able to control the car if necessary.</p><p><strong>Speed limits and traffic laws are the same for learner drivers as they are for fully licensed drivers.</strong> You need to obey the speed limit and all other traffic laws, including giving way to other vehicles and pedestrians. If you break a traffic law, you could be fined or even lose your learner&rsquo;s license.</p><p>It&rsquo;s also important to maintain a safe driving record. If you have too many demerit points on your license, you could be disqualified from driving. This could make it difficult to get a job or insurance.</p><p><strong>Here are some additional safety tips for learner drivers:</strong></p><ul><li>Always wear your seatbelt.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t use your cell phone while driving.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t drink and drive.</li><li>Be aware of your surroundings and other drivers.</li><li>Drive defensively.</li></ul><p><strong>By following these safety tips, you can help to reduce your risk of being involved in a car accident.</strong></p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li>Learner drivers must have a supervisor in the car with them at all times.</li><li>Learner drivers must obey the same speed limits and traffic laws as fully licensed drivers.</li><li>Learner drivers should maintain a safe driving record to avoid disqualification from driving.</li><li>Learner drivers should always wear their seatbelt, not use their cell phone while driving, and not drink and drive.</li><li>Learner drivers should be aware of their surroundings and other drivers and drive defensively.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion-emphasize-responsible-driving-adherence-to-regulations-and-safety-as-a-learner-driver><strong>Conclusion: Emphasize Responsible Driving, Adherence to Regulations, and Safety as a Learner Driver.</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion-emphasize-responsible-driving-adherence-to-regulations-and-safety-as-a-learner-driver>#</a></h2><p>As a learner driver, taking responsibility for your actions is the key to ensuring a safe and positive driving experience.
